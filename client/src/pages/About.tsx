              In 2005 we expanded into pressed steel flush doors, and over the following decade grew into a dedicated fire-rated door specialist, integrating global testing
              standards into local manufacturing. Today, as part of the Royal Fab Group, we supply and install fire-rated, scientific, general-purpose, and aluminium and glass door systems for
              commercial, institutional, and residential clients across Chennai and Pondicherry.
